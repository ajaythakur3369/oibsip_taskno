# Oasis Infobyte Internship

This internship was all about data science and analytics. I applied for this internship from the website of Oasis Infobyte. I completed all the 5 tasks. The description of all the tasks is given below:

## **Task - 1: Iris Flower Classification**

I predicted the species of Iris Flower using the attributes given such as: petal length, sepal length, petal width and sepal width. I used logistic regression model for classification of species.

## **Task - 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python**

I explored the dataset by creating various charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn libraries of python.

## **Task - 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**

I predicted the price of the car on different factors such as goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower, mileage and many more. I used linear regression model for predicting the price of the car.

## **Task - 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning**

I created a support vector machine classifier for detecting messages as spam or non-spam. I also calculated the accuracy of the model to check its efficiency. The accuracy score was 0.977.

## **Task - 5: Sales Prediction using Python**

I used linear regression model for forecasting the sales.
